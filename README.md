# Website Color Scheme Impact Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze whether a new brightly colored version of a website leads to increased visitor engagement time compared to the old version. We utilize statistical hypothesis testing to determine the significance of the observed differences.

## Files in this Repository
- `website_analysis_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis, including the project scope, goals, data processing steps, and conclusions.
- `version_time.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the Jupyter notebook.
- `.gitignore`: Files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `LICENSE`: The licensing terms for this project.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the `website_analysis_project.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

## Project Goals
- Understand the impact of the new color scheme on visitor engagement.
- Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the time spent on the old and new versions of the website.
- Interpret the results and provide actionable insights.

## Conclusion
The project concludes with a determination of whether the new website version significantly impacts visitor time based on the results of the statistical tests.
